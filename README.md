The save and new note buttons don't work even after adding the fix.  I tried to build the routes correctly, but I have no way of checking to see if they function the way they're supposed to because I can't actually save anything.

The server is set to localhost:4900.

The apiRoutes.js file handles the communication between the client side and the server, sending and retrieving notes as requested by the user. It also handles the conversion of the passed files to JSON.

The htmlRoutes.js handles the page transitions.
